# Covarate

Covarate is a Django Covid-19 web app with ML. This website can provide live update of covid-19 situation in all over the world and It can predict covid-19 infection probability of any person by some common symptoms like body temperature,breathing difficulty level etc...people have to fill up the contact form and they can easily see the infection probability in a percentage value. I have used Logistic Regression for the prediction method.
